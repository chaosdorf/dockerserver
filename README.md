Docker hosting at our space

This repository contains config for the [dockerserver VM running at Chaosdorf](https://wiki.chaosdorf.de/Host:Dockerserver) (`dockerserver.chaosdorf.space`).

This is just the stuff that isn't being managed by docker swarm;
for this please see <https://github.com/chaosdorf/docker-stacks>.
